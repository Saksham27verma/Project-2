    <p>Dear Haathi,<br>
        <br>
        I think it is pretty obvious that I love you so much because I am on the verge on failing tomorrow but here I am writing this to you.
        <br><br>
        This month seemed so so so so so long. The longest. But finally it's over and we have officially been dating for 3 months!!
        <br><br>
        It was very fun going back to Bangla Sahib again and I could actually go there while being relaxed and not on a time constraint, we got to have the halwa finally, although we couldn't bow together :/// Pagal pahale hi chali gayi aage bina peeche dekhe :///<br>
        <br>
        But yes, it was veryy fun only second to... the hot-... my HOME. Not once but twice Â¬â€¿Â¬
        No further words for that.<br>
        <br>
        I also saw to what extent you suffer during your periods through my eyes and promise ki I will take care of you during that time like I did this time. (Although I was super fucking nervous about your mom seeing me from the balcony).<br>
        <br>
        Baaki maine aur likha toh sahi mein fail ho jaaoonga, you already know what you mean to me.<br>
        <br>
        Happy 3 months anniversary!!<br>
        Here's to watching more shitty movies and shows together that I make you watch and occassionally finding that one 'Sunflower' which makes us engrossed. ðŸ“º
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you <br>
        Pratham</p>
