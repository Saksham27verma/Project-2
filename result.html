    <p>Dear Haathi,<br>
        <br>
        It's been 2 months of us being together!! <br>
        <br>
        which means,
   
        <div style="margin-left: 50px;">
        it's been 2 months since I have started feeling this happy,<br>
        it's been 2 months since I have started feeling complete,<br>
        it's been 2 months since I tasted your sweet lips,<br>
        it's been 2 month since I found my best friend and my wife.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        I'd sacrifice watching a married couple fight and create drama in NSP just because you feel uncomfortable, that's how much I love you.<br>
        <br>
        More than ever, you are always on my mind when we are not talking and more than ever I want to tell my other half about things that just happened. (Ye likhte likhte ek aur cheez yaad aa gayi jo maine hote hi socha tha tujhe bataoonga but phir bata nahi paaya, abhi pooch le mujhse agar mere saamne padh rahi hai toh)<br>
        <br>
        Having you motivates and drives me to work harder and be more successful so I can give you the best and also convince papa and mummy to give me your hand taaki tujhe bhaga ke shaadi na karni padhe 😭😞.<br>
        But anyway, you make me want to become better in all aspects and I couldn't ask for more.<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for being the best person to go to weird places like a toilet museum with, being the best binge partner to watch shows with (although I have to force you sometimes but whatever), being the best friend to shamelessly laugh with in NSP, being the best person to be on bed with 😏 and being the best person to have a shower with 😏. <br>
        <br>
        Happy 2 months anniversary wifey.<br>
        Here's to so many more years of me hitting you with my belt. 🍷
        <br>
        <br>
        I love you <br>
        Pratham</p>
