    <p>Dear Haathi,
        <br>
        It's been a whole month since we started officially dating!!!!! <br>
        <br>
        WOW, SO MUCH has happened this month. <br>
   
        <div style="margin-left: 50px;">
        I had my first kiss with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I confessed (again) to the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I went to a gurudwara with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I made-out with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I watched anime with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I fingered the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I had boba tea with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I told my parents about the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I attended a college fest with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        I attended a concert with the love of my life ðŸ˜³<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        and so so much more... <br>
        <br>
        How does it feel being in a relationship with the best man in the world? ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž<br>
        <br>
        Anyways, let me keep this short and wrap it up by saying a few things more because SOME PEOPLE find monthly anniversary wishes CRINGE. (lmao taunt again, I think you've had enough today now) <br>
        <br>
        You already feel like a wife who I share everything with, I love telling you about my day and getting to know about yours, I am very grateful for having you and I love you so much. My kaalu friend already told you how I smile much more now that I have you, whatever people or friends say doesn't bother me anymore - I overthink a lot less now because only your opinion matters now. <br>
        <br>
        Happy 1 month anniversary baby. <br>
        (abb kar cringe, KAR NA) <br>
        <br>
        Good job on increasing your weight to a whopping 43kg, I hope to continue contributing in increasing it more and more. <br>
        <br>
        I love you <br>
        Pratham</p>
