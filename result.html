    <p>Dear Haathi,<br>
        <br>
        We have officially been dating for 5 months now!!!
        <br><br>
        I am really glad that you all bought the new house today 🥹, you will soon be moving and I wish my dear wife gets all the happiness she deserves and gets to decorate her new room however she likes. Mujhe literally itna gussa aaya jabb papa ne kaha that you can't put on posters because deewar kharab ho jaayegi, BILKUL MATT SUNNA. Jaise marzi decorate it and enjoy the new home.
        <br><br>
        Also, I am sorry baby that we couldn't meet a lot this month but I'll change it soon bass free hone do (meri game bass khatam hone do 😔😏). I am also sorry about making you sad and cry yesterday, in case I had a hand in it - but I can't feel too guilty about it either because... boobs the toh sundar. <br>
        Also you made my heart skip a beat by saying 'I can't live without you' for the first time, it made me happy but also made me feel scared about all the responsibility it implied... but I am more than ready to take it if it's you 💓.
        <br><br>
        I didn't have any choice to begin with anyway. <br>
        Especially when that girl has let me feel her butthole from inside. 😏<br>
        <br>
        but again, you saying that to me made my heart flutter so muchhhhh. Thank you for loving me this much Navya.
        <br><br>
        Still, there was something this month that made my heart flutter even more.. <br>
        "Baby please andar daal do".
        <br><br>
        Dekho phirse horny baatein start kar doonga main 😭😭😭, vaise bhi I am running out of things to say in these letters - we are too healthy of a couple and communicate WAY TOO MUCH. (🧿 nazar na lage this thing is so good.)
        <br>
        <br>
        Anywaysss I am loving watching Death Note with you these days and I hope we watch a lot more anime together 😚.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for being the best girlfriend.
        <br><br>
        Happy 5 months anniversary!!
        <br><br>
        I love you <br>
        Pratham
