    <p>Dear Haathi,<br>
        <br>
        We have been officially dating for 1/4th of an year!!! (fuck I was about to drop my iPhone again as soon as I typed this, I should really get that screen guard after all).
        <br><br>
        I am so happy about mummy knowing about us and approving us ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ (as long as she doesn't snitch to papa). This was the biggest thing that happened this month, WOW. I really do think you are intelligent but my god tuu pagal hai, baithe baithe pata nahi kya chul hai it could've completely gone wrong. BUT I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT IT ANYWAY SO WHATEVER.
        <br><br>
        I am also very weirdly happy about getting to interact with Ananya and Himanshi didi getting to know about it as well, please arrange that meeting with your sisters - I am not kidding, please make it happen, I am excited.<br>
        <br>
        You've had a lot of issues with friendship this month and a lot of that might be because of me. But as I said, abhi thoda low chal raha hai ye maamla but theek ho jaayega (why do you even need friends when you have me wtf? ðŸ¥´). It's very good that these stupid non-ambitious jealous ass people are out of your life.<br>
        <br>
        Other than that my god, how do you keep getting sexier my pretty wife. <br>
        STOP DOING IT, you are going to give me a fapping addiction. <br>
        I also got to see you sing on the stage, you look even cooler than I thought you did. So weird, different and surprising to see my small tiny baby being up there and being so confident and dominant. Love it.<br>
        <br>
        We finally got to watch a movie, we went on a double date (gonna add double date to the list and cross it off), we went to mystery rooms, we got to be bagless and we got to each churros. Such a good month bhyi. ðŸ˜­
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for being the perfect ice-cream and boba mommy who sucks at bowling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Being separated from you when I went to Dubai was so tough, I would keep checking if there's data so I could tell you all the minor things that happened at the time. It physically pained to not get to tell you stuff right there instantly. Pratham can't live without telling Navya everything.
        <br><br>
        You are my lucky charm, problems get solved when I tell you about them. <br>
        You are mine, for eternity. <br>
        (please get rid of your guilt, I want to fuck you so badly) <br>
        (I can imagine you saying ki phir le aaya ye topic ðŸ˜­ - well your fault, that's what happens when you send a pic of you with a satin shirt on, an exposed & very kissable neck along with a skirt I can go right under - YOUR FAULT)
        <br><br>
        I'll end this here, abb horny kar diya - pagal. <br>
        Happy 4 months anniversary!!
        <br><br>
        I love you <br>
        Pratham
